# Fortune Telling

## Execution

To run the project, open the folder containing the source code in Visual Studio Code. If you haven’t already, install the "Open in Browser" extension by TechER.

Once that’s done, double-click on the "index.html" file and select "Open in Default Browser".

A window will then open in your browser with the homepage. *(Please note: the website is in French.)*

## About the Site

As soon as the site launches, you’ll land on the start page. Click on "Start" to continue. Next, you can choose your zodiac sign by hovering your mouse over one of the symbols representing your sign (for fire: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius; earth: Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo; air: Libra, Aquarius, Gemini; water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces).

Once you’ve selected your sign, you’ll arrive on a page with all the information about it (personality, compatibility, etc.). Each sign also has its own associated color and a few memes for fun.

At the top of each sign’s page, you can click on "Predictions for you!" which will take you to a page where you can ask the crystal ball for insights about your future. When you're done playing with the crystal ball, you can click "back" at the bottom of the page (scroll down if you don't see it), and you’ll be redirected to the homepage where you can choose your sign again.

At the bottom of each zodiac sign page, there’s a small form you can fill out and submit by clicking "Send" to share your thoughts about the site.

This project, created in 2020, is the result of a collaboration between two creative minds. We combined our ideas to make something awesome!
